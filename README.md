# MySOM
This is an implementation of Self-Organizing Maps and Recurrent Self-Organizing Maps.

It has been created as part of my master thesis 'Combining HyperNEAT and MPF to Create Adaptable Networks' written in the Spring and Summer of 2015 at the IT University of Copenhagen.

It is used in the MyMPF and HyperNEAT-MPF programs found in my repository.
